# bipedal-walker

This is a simple implementation of the [BipedalWalker-v3](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/bipedal_walker/) environment from OpenAI Gym. <br>
We attempt to solve the environment using 3 algorithms: Augmented Random Search, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and a Deep Q-network. <br>

## Results

The environment is trained for 10000 episodes. <br>
